# Stable diffusion from scratch

Welcome everyone, I would like to start Readme from questions to myself.

**Why did I decide to create this repo?**
I started this project with purpose to understand how stable diffusion works, which math it uses. I've read a lot of articles with math explanation and code implementation, but I didn't find something which make connection between code and math in the one place.

**Am I guru of Diffusion models?**
Absolutely no, better say I'm not ML engineer right now, but I really want to work at this position oneday.

**Do you need to have a degree to understand math?**
No, everyone needs to understand some basic formulas from statistic theory, a little bit algebra, but more important time to spend for analyze and process this information into your brain. Also I try to include links to some basic formulas or good explanation of theory, that you can read if you get stuck.

### How to better read this repo?

Latent diffusion models based on Diffusion models. It's the heart of Stable diffusion and it's really important to understand what is diffusion, how it works and how is it possible to make any picture in our imagination from just a noise.

1. Start with math_check.ipynb . This is my expanation of math behind diffusion models, based on great articles of other authors and my research. It took two weeks to understand in all details all formulas for me, but I tried to give informaiton more easily.
2. Next go to Diffusion model, which is an implementation of original paper in PyTorch
3.
